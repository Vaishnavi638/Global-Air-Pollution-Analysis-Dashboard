Using a comprehensive dataset, the dashboard transforms raw environmental data into actionable insights regarding Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, major pollutants, and regional impact.

Key Features :
Interactive Visuals: Dynamic charts and maps that allow users to explore pollution levels by country and city.
Pollutant Breakdown: Detailed analysis of key pollutants.
AQI Categorization: Visual classification of air quality (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.) based on international standards.
Slicer-Driven Navigation: Easily filter data by Region, and Air Quality for a customized view.

Tools & Technologies :
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, PivotTables, and Dashboard design.
Power Query: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to ensure data accuracy.
Data Visualization: Custom charts, conditional formatting, and interactive slicers.
